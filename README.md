# Bootstrap Editor

Bootstrap editor is an experiment that aims to create a drag and drop interface for Twitter's Bootstrap,
it uses:

* boostrap (obviously)
* jquery
* jquery-ui
* HTML5
* CSS3

Although it's current status is still alpha/beta, it's somewhat usable. Feel free to contact me in order
to contribute to this project.
